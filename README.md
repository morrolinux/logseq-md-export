# logseq-md-export
Prototype utility for exporting logseq pages to standard markdown, including images, drawio drawings, assets and stuff.

The implementation is a bit rushed, and needs some cleaning up, but everything should work fine in most cases. \
If not, please **open an Issue** describing the problem (screenshots are also useful) and attach the relevant logseq page.
